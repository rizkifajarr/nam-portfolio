          About Me
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          I&#39;m a dedicated and detail-oriented graduate in Sharia Banking
          from IAIN Pontianak, honored with Cum Laude (GPA 3.88). My
          professional background includes hands-on experience in
          administration, document handling, and data management within
          financial and office environments. I actively participated in campus
          organizations and enjoy working collaboratively. Proficient in office
          software with a strong sense of accuracy and responsibility, I&#39;m
          eager to contribute to the growth and operations of Islamic finance
          and banking institutions.
